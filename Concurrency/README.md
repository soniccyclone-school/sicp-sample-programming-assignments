# Concurrency

## Relevant sections in text: 3.4

This assignment explores issues of synchronization and concurrency in the context of simulating a currency-exchange market.

The code for this assignment relies on the parallel-execute facility (see the text, section 3.4). If you are not running MIT Scheme, this may be difficult to arrange. The file parallel.scm below gives an implementation of parallel-execute in terms of primitives included in MIT Scheme, but which are not part of the Scheme standard.
