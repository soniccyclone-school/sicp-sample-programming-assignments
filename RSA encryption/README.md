# RSA encryption

## Relevant sections in text: 1.2.6, 2.2.1

The assignment begins with the fast exponentiation and primality testing in section 1.2 and expands it to produce an implementation of the RSA system for public-key encryption. Students will also need to use lists to represent sequences and write simple car-cdr manipulations.

Before assigning this, you should consider updating "the story" to something more contemporary and less MIT-specific.

Disclaimer for all the cryptographers who are waiting to pounce on us: The system described here is a "pure RSA" system, which is not secure in practice.
